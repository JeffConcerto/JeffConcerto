## About Me

I'm a self-taught iOS Developer with a background in English and Motion Pictures. Over the past few years, I've transitioned into software development, focusing on building intuitive and dynamic mobile applications using Swift and SwiftUI.

- üíª I work primarily with **Swift, SwiftUI,** and **iOS Development.**
- üéÆ I'm passionate about developing engaging and user-friendly apps, with a recent focus on game development.
- üìö Currently diving deeper into **Swift 6.0** and exploring advanced data structures.

## LeetCode
I do at least one LeetCode question a day to keep from getting rusty and to sharpen my data structures and algorithm skills. I haven't missed a day in over two years.

- **[LeetCode Profile](https://leetcode.com/NoMansGhost/):** Follow my daily progress and see the problems I‚Äôve solved.
- **[LeetCode Repository](https://github.com/JeffConcerto/leetcode):** Check out my solutions and code explanations on GitHub.
